# [My Knowledge Wiki üåø](https://wiki.reckoning.dev)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.reckoning.dev) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/wiki.reckoning.dev).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

Below are [notes](https://github.com/sadanand-singh/wiki.reckoning.dev/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) & their relations visualized.

## Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the tree view to the left.

Aside from this wiki, I share things via my [Blog](https://reckoning.dev) and build [Learn Anything](ideas/learn-anything.md).

## Grow your own digital garden üå±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](other/wiki-workflow.md#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
