# Are Deep Neural Networks Dramatically Overfitted?

The effort in understanding why deep neural networks can generalize somehow reminds me of this interesting paper on System Biology — [“Can a biologist fix a radio?”](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108%2802%2900133-2.pdf) \(Lazebnik, 2002\). If a biologist intends to fix a radio machine like how she works on a biological system, life could be hard. Because the full mechanism of the radio system is not revealed, poking small local functionalities might give some hints but it can hardly present all the interactions within the system, let alone the entire working flow. No matter whether you think it is relevant to DL, it is a very fun read.
