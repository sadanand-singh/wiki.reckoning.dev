# Gradient Boosted Decision Trees

`Gradient boosting` is a machine learning technique for regression and classification where multiple models are trained `sequentially` with each model trying to learn the mistakes from the previous models. The individual models are known as `weak learners` and in the case of `gradient boosted decision trees` the individual models are decision trees.

This article details usage and concepts of GBDTs in great detail.
