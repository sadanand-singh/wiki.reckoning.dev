## [Domain Adaptive Image-to-Image Translation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Chen_Domain_Adaptive_Image-to-Image_Translation_CVPR_2020_paper.html)

Unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) has achieved great success in various applications. However, its generalization capacity is still an open question. In this paper, we show that existing I2I models do not generalize well for samples outside the training domain. The cause is twofold.
