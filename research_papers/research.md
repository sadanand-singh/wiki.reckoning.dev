# Research Papers

Being a research scientist makes me read/glance through hundreds of papers a month. In this section,
I add all of the papers that I go through. Only a handful of these though actually end up in my final
Zotero library.

I try to organize the papers into sub categories as follows:

- [Medical Imaging](./medical_imaging.md)
- [CNNs](./cnn.md)
- [Object Detection](./object_detection.md)
- [GANs](./gans.md)
- [Transformers](./transformers.md)
- [Misc](./misc.md)

My research papers come from various online sources, the prominent ones are:

- Various Conferences like NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, SPIE Medical Imaging etc.
- [arxiv sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/library)
