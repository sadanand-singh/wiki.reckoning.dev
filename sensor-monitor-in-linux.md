# Sensor Monitor in Linux

The Psensor sensor monitoring tool for Linux distributions can measure the temperature of CPU, GPU, memory, and other hardware elements. We all know that the proper utilization of system hardware can make a system faster and smooth. Sometimes, a well-balanced system can run slow due to overheating issues. Monitoring the hardware temperature can save your system from a crash. Modern computers and notebooks are getting smaller day by day. As a result, the cooling system is getting compromised, mainly on notebooks and laptops. If you are a [Linux system administrator](https://www.ubuntupit.com/things-to-know-for-becoming-a-successful-linux-system-administrator/), you should monitor both the hardware and software status. You can install and use the Psensor sensor tool to monitor your Linux systemâ€™s hardware temper to avoid overheating damages.
